# Pat's React Portfolio

## Description

  - This project is my portfolio using React so that it is a Single Page Application (SPA).
  - I wanted to show that I could create a single page application with React.
  - I built this not only to use React, but to update my portfolio and make it look better from the previous portfolio and I added my resume.
  - This portfolio is a single page application so the user stays on one page.
  - I learned how to use React to create JSX components.
